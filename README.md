# MicroFounder Network

A calm home for people who build.

## Philosophy

MicroFounder Network exists for builders who value clarity over noise.

**What this is:**
- A quiet, curated space for independent builders
- A place to think clearly and build deliberately
- A community that grows carefully, not virally

**What this isn't:**
- A forum, Slack, or Discord
- A growth hack or networking platform
- A place to perform or chase attention

We believe the best communities are small by design, not by accident.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** Next.js App Router, deployed on Vercel
- **Backend:** Supabase (shared with Ark ecosystem)
- **Analytics:** Vercel Analytics (privacy-respecting)

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables
